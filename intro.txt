I selected level 1 out of 3 levels for my virtual internship at CODSOFT.

Task 1 is landing page:
    "I have created a landing page for NOVA CLEAN robot vaccum cleaners. All images(hero-img and products img) and video for the deals section were generated by me, ensuring originality and avoiding external resources." 

Task 2 is portfolio:
    "I have created a portfolio for a sample member, John Bennet. All images (hero-img and projects-img) were generated by me, ensuring originality and avoiding external resources. I created the portfolio based on the requirements of Task 2 and completed it successfully, including extra features such as responsiveness and a navigation bar."

Task 3 is calculator:
    "I built a calculator to meet the needs of Task 3, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, incorporating event listeners, if-else logic, operators, and loops. I successfully completed the project, adding responsiveness as an extra feature."
